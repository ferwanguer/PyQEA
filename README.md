# PyQEA
> Research toolkit for Quantum Inspired hyper-normal optimization in python


PyQEA is an extensive research library for Quantum inspired hyper-normal based
optimization in python. 

It is intended for the solution of global optimization problems where conventional 
genetic algorithms or PSO yield un-optimal results. PyQEA supports high dimensional optimization problems with non-linear constraints.
